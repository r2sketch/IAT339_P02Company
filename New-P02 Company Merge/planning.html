        We will be there with you every step of the way. We will do the “homework” and come up with a budget that works for you and prepare a call to action. We contact and secure the major plot points by giving you options to assemble your dream
        cast of vendors.
      </p>
      <p>We help set the setting by advising on design from venue to flowers to the tablescape! We create a flawless day of timeline, coordinate the rehearsal with the secondary characters to make sure your wedding party is whipped into shape. Run
        the
        full setup on the day and stress about the minor details for you.
      </p>
